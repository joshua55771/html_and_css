      <h2>How Latin has affected Law</h2>
      <p>Latin has had a profound and lasting impact on the development of Western legal systems, beginning with its role as the language of Roman law. The Roman legal tradition, especially as codified in the Corpus Juris Civilis under Emperor Justinian, established foundational legal principles and terminology that continue to shape modern jurisprudence. Latin terms such as lex (law), ius (right), contractus (contract), and delictum (wrongdoing) were not only used in legal texts but also embedded into the very logic of legal reasoning. During the Middle Ages, Latin remained the dominant language of legal scholarship across Europe. Canon law, developed by the Catholic Church, was written and administered in Latin, influencing secular legal systems in areas like marriage, inheritance, and moral conduct. Universities that trained lawyers—such as those in Bologna and Paris—taught Roman law in Latin, and legal scholars wrote extensive commentaries in the language, ensuring its continuity as a medium of legal thought. Even as vernacular languages began to replace Latin in everyday use, legal systems retained many Latin maxims and phrases for their precision and authority. In common law traditions, expressions like habeas corpus (you shall have the body), mens rea (guilty mind), and stare decisis (to stand by things decided) remain central to legal discourse. Latin also served as a gatekeeper of legal knowledge, accessible primarily to the educated elite, and helped unify legal scholarship across linguistic boundaries. Its legacy endures not only in the vocabulary of law but in the very structure and philosophy of legal systems around the world.
