       <p>The Overworld is where you start your journey in Minecraft. The Overworld is a resoursce heavy Landscape that is simmilar to earth. Your able to venture through biomes such as the Desert, Plains, Ocean, Cherry Grove, Jungle, and many others. There are als fictisious biomes such as the pale garden. This biome is very unique and can be found within a dark forest. At first when you see the biome it seems lifeless, gray moss covering the ground, trees with gray bark and gray leaves, dark flowers with no color. The pale garden stays this way till night. At night the Pale Garden comes alive, those flowers that were dark grey have bloomed and now are bright orange, mobs lurk around every corner, and then the trees come alive. What you didnt know about those pale lifeless trees is that the contain the heart of the Creaking. These tree mobs that only come out at night are determined to kill you, but if you look at them, like the weeping angels from Dr Who, they cant move. This is your only advantage because they are also unkillable. The only way to kill the Creaking is to destroy its Heart.</p>

       <p>There are many biomes simmilar to real life such as the Dessert, Ice Spikes, Snowy Tiga, and Forests. The Dessert is a Desoliate biome that only has dead bushes and cacti for plants. In these vast plains of sand you can find a couple different type of animals such as the cammel and bunny. The cammel is a rideable mob that you can find either wondering in the desert or near desert villages. 
        The Ice Spikes biome could be compared to glaciers, featuring towering ice formations and a cold, harsh environment. These towering ice sculptures contain 3 different types of ice. Ice, packed ice, and blue ice. These different types of ice have different uses. Regular ice will melt when it is not in a cold biome such as Snowy Tiga or Ice Spikes. Packed ice is a more solid form of ice that does not melt, and blue ice is the most solid form of ice. Blue ice is used to make ice boats go faster.
         The Snowy Tiga biome is a cold, snowy forest filled with tall spruce trees and occasional wolves. This biome is perfect for players looking to gather wood and hunt for food in a chilly environment. In this biome you can find powdered snow, which is a unique type of snow that cant be used to craft snow golems or snow. It is a trap for players and mobs, if you fall into powdered snow you will start to freeze and eventually die if you dont get out. To get out of powdered snow you need to either use leather boots or other blocks to get out.
          The Forest biome is a lush, green area filled with tall trees, flowers, and various animals. This biome is perfect for players looking to gather wood and hunt for food. In the forest biome you can find many different types of trees such as oak, birch, and dark oak. Each type of tree has its own unique wood type that can be used for crafting and building.</p>
