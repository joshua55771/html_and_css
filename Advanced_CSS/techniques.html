    <h3>MIG Welding</h3>
   <p id="para-one">
      MIG welding, or Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), uses a continuous wire feed and shielding gas to create strong welds quickly. It's ideal for beginners due to its ease of use and clean results. MIG is commonly used in automotive repair, fabrication, and construction. The process is efficient and works well with thin metals. However, it requires a stable environment since wind can disrupt the shielding gas. Proper setup and technique are key to achieving high-quality welds. Safety gear like gloves and a helmet are essential to protect against sparks and UV radiation.

    <h3>TIG Welding</h3>
    <p>
      TIG welding, or Tungsten Inert Gas Welding, is known for its precision and clean finish. It uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode and requires a separate filler rod. TIG is ideal for thin materials and critical welds in aerospace and medical industries. The process demands skill and patience, as the welder must control both the torch and filler rod simultaneously. TIG produces minimal spatter and allows for detailed work. It's slower than other methods but offers unmatched control. Mastering TIG takes time, but the results are worth the effort.

      <li>Use proper electrode and filler material</li>
      <li>Maintain correct travel speed</li>
      <li>Ensure consistent arc length</li>
    </ul>
