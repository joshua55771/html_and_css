      <h3 class="subheading">Precision vs Speed</h3>
      <p id="para-one">TIG welding, short for Tungsten Inert Gas welding, is a method prized for its precision and clean finish. It uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode and requires a separate filler rod. This technique is ideal for thin materials and applications where aesthetics matter, such as aerospace or automotive detailing. MIG welding, or Metal Inert Gas welding, is faster and more accessible for beginners. It uses a consumable wire electrode and is well-suited for thicker metals and industrial fabrication. Both methods require proper shielding gas and technique to avoid porosity and ensure strong welds. Understanding the differences helps welders choose the right method for each job. Safety gear is essential for both, including gloves, helmets, and protective clothing.</p>
      <p id="para-two">Heat control is critical in both TIG and MIG welding. Excessive heat can cause warping, while insufficient heat leads to poor penetration. Welders often use techniques like backstepping and stitch welding to manage heat distribution. TIG welding allows for finer control, making it ideal for intricate work, while MIG welding excels in speed and efficiency. Practice and experience are key to mastering these methods. Clean metal surfaces and consistent arc length are crucial for quality welds. With proper training, these techniques can produce high-quality, durable welds in various applications. Always follow safety protocols to minimize risks and ensure long-term success in welding projects.</p>
