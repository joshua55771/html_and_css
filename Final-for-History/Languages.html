  <h2>How different languages were created via Latin</h2>
  <div id="overworld1" class="main-content">
    
      
       <p>One major instance where Latin influenced languages is through the development of the Romance languages. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Latin evolved differently in various regions of Europe, giving rise to languages such as Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. These languages are directly descended from Vulgar Latin—the everyday spoken form used by common people in the Roman Empire. As Latin mixed with local dialects and underwent phonetic and grammatical changes over centuries, it transformed into distinct yet related languages. This shared origin explains why Romance languages have similar vocabulary, sentence structure, and verb conjugations.

       <p>Another way Latin has shaped languages is through its lasting impact on English vocabulary. Although English is a Germanic language, it has absorbed a vast number of Latin words, especially through the influence of the Norman Conquest and the Church. Many English words in law, science, medicine, and education—such as justice, biology, manual, and curriculum—are derived from Latin roots. Latin prefixes and suffixes like pre-, sub-, -tion, and -able are also common in English, helping to form new words and clarify meaning. This influence has made Latin a foundational element in academic and technical English, even though it was never the spoken language of the English people.
