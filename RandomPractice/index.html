    <h1>Hello my name is Joshua. I am a Junior at Stem School Chattanooga. You are probably woundering why a you have a highschooler in your college class. At STEM you have two options, you can either use the dual enrollment grant or the Middle College Grant. The Middle College Grant is not what is recomended but you are allowed to use it. It is not recommended because you have to keep your GPA above a 3.6 and also have to take 12 college credits per semester. Being that I love a challenge I chose the later option. I am taking two 3 credit classes per quater so that I do not have too much work. One of those classes is oviously Comunications 2025. I am taking Communications 2025 to help me become better at speeches and general communication. I am also taking Intro into HTML and CSS. These are two of the three main coding languages that you use for making websites. I intend to use this in my future when I go to bluesky. Bluesky is a coding school that is local in which you learn coding 2 to 3 times faster than the average school does. After the 2 year course is completed you have a guarented job at blue cross blue shield starting at about 60 to 70 grand a year. you also are able to a aply at places like google. This brings me to one of my hobbies, coding. I have done a few small coding projects but this is my most complex. Your probably woundering how is a writen speech for Communications a coding project? Sence I love a chalenge I have coded a working website that contains my speach and then copied it into a document</h1>
