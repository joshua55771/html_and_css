    <h2>What Is Welding?</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>History of Welding</h3>
    <p>
      Welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing coalescence. It dates back thousands of years, with early examples found in the Bronze Age. Over time, welding has evolved into a highly technical and essential skill in modern manufacturing, construction, and repair. Today, it plays a critical role in industries ranging from aerospace to automotive. Welders use various techniques depending on the materials and desired strength of the joint. The process requires precision, knowledge of metallurgy, and safety awareness. Welding continues to be a cornerstone of industrial progress.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Welding Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Welding is more than just melting metalâ€”it's about creating strong, lasting bonds that hold our world together. From bridges and skyscrapers to pipelines and ships, welded structures are everywhere. Skilled welders are in high demand, and the trade offers rewarding career paths with opportunities for specialization. The artistry of welding also extends into sculpture and creative metalwork. With proper training and equipment, welders can produce clean, durable joints that meet rigorous standards. As technology advances, welding techniques continue to improve, making the process safer and more efficient.

    <h2>Popular Welding Methods</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>MIG Welding</h3>
    <p>
      MIG welding, or Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), uses a continuous wire feed and shielding gas to create strong welds quickly. It's ideal for beginners due to its ease of use and clean results. MIG is commonly used in automotive repair, fabrication, and construction. The process is efficient and works well with thin metals. However, it requires a stable environment since wind can disrupt the shielding gas. Proper setup and technique are key to achieving high-quality welds. Safety gear like gloves and a helmet are essential to protect against sparks and UV radiation.
    </p>

    <h3>TIG Welding</h3>
    <p>
      TIG welding, or Tungsten Inert Gas Welding, is known for its precision and clean finish. It uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode and requires a separate filler rod. TIG is ideal for thin materials and critical welds in aerospace and medical industries. The process demands skill and patience, as the welder must control both the torch and filler rod simultaneously. TIG produces minimal spatter and allows for detailed work. It's slower than other methods but offers unmatched control. Mastering TIG takes time, but the results are worth the effort.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clean work surface before welding</li>
      <li>Use proper electrode and filler material</li>
      <li>Maintain correct travel speed</li>
      <li>Ensure consistent arc length</li>
    </ul>
